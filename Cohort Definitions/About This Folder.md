The purpose of this folder is to drop text files for collaborating on the exposure and outcome definitions. 

## Building Cohorts
Cohort definitions can be built via [Public ATLAS](http://atlas-demo.ohdsi.org/). 

### Cohort 101
If you need help building cohorts, you may consult [The Book of OHDSI - Chapter 10: Defining Cohorts](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/Cohorts.html) for information on how to build a cohort using ATLAS.

### To Export
You can export the cohort definition from ATLAS when you go to the **"Export"** tab and click **"JSON"** and then click **"Copy to Clipboard"**. The copied information can be copied into a Notepad or Notepad++ file. 

It is encouraged to use a naming convention similar to this: *[Choose one: Target, Comparator, Outcome -- e.g. Outcome] - [Brief String to Describe Cohort -- e.g. Hand OA].json* where the brackets are deleted and the corresponding information is added accordingly. Where possible, saving as a **.json** is preferred. To do this, simple put it at the end **.json** of your filename when you are typing it in. Once you save your cohort, you can use the Upload function to place it into this folder for collaboration purposes.
