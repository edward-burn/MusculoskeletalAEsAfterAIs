The purpose of this folder is to drop text files for collaborating on the exposure and outcome definitions. Cohort definitions can be taken from ATLAS when you go to the "Export" tab and click "JSON" and "Copy to Clipboard". The copied information can be copied into a Notepad or Notepad++ file. The file should be saved a convention similar to this: "[Choose one: Target, Comparator, Outcome -- e.g. Outcome] - [Brief String to Describe Cohort -- e.g. Hand OA].json" where the brackets are deleted and the content is added accordingly. Where possible, saving as a .json is preefrred. To do this, simple put it at the end ".json" of your filename when you are typing it in. Once you save your cohort, you can use the Upload function to place it into this folder for collaboration purposes.
